Expense Visualization: Generate visual representations like charts or graphs to help users visualize their expenses by category, month, or any other relevant parameter. This can provide insights into spending patterns and trends.

Budget Setting: Allow users to set monthly or weekly budgets for different expense categories. The application can provide notifications or warnings when users approach or exceed their budget limits.

You can also consider additional features such as currency conversion, multi-device synchronization, or integration with bank accounts for automated expense tracking. Start with a basic set of features and iterate based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
